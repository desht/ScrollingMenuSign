# ScrollingMenuSign v0.6.2

ScrollingMenuSign is a Bukkit plugin that allows you to attach a scrolling command menu to any sign on your CraftBukkit
Minecraft server.  A command menu consists of a title and zero or more entries: a label, a command to execute, and an optional
feedback message to send to the player.  By default, players can scroll through the menu entries on a sign by right-clicking it,
and execute the currently-selected entry by left-clicking it, but this is fully configurable.

## Installation

Very simple: copy ScrollingMenuSign.jar into your plugins/ folder.  Restart/reload your server.  Done.

## Usage
